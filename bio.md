My name is Garrett Jespersen
I live in Pierce City, Missouri
It's a small town southwest of Springfield. There are probably more people enrolled in MSU than people in Pierce City.
It's about 45 minutes away
I work on a farm where we take care of about 300-400 head of cattle and about 35,000 turkeys.
I like to hunt, fish, play games, play sports, watch sports etc. 
Unfortunatley I can't bring myself to root for the Bills. I like them. However, I like the 49ers a lot more.
